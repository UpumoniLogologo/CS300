## Course Overview  
This course introduces fundamental concepts, techniques, and strategies related to **networking systems, management, and virtualization**. It covers both **hardware and software aspects** of networking, from low-level data transmission to high-level network applications.  

I gained hands-on experience in designing, developing, and managing network systems while exploring virtualization technologies. Key topics include:  
- Media and bit-level data transmission  
- Packet transmission and switching  
- Internetworking and network protocols  
- Network configuration and management  
- Security considerations in networking  
- Data communication and network applications  

## My Work  
Throughout this course, I worked on various **networking exercises and projects**, including:  
- **Packet Tracers:** Simulating and troubleshooting network configurations  
- **Network Design & Configuration:** Setting up and managing networks using different protocols  
- **Virtualization Setup:** Configuring virtual network environments  
- **Security Implementations:** Applying basic security measures to protect network infrastructures
